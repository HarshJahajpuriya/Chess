                                The <b> King </b> moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A
                                special move with the king known as Castling is allowed only once per player, per game.

                                moved when castling.

                            <li>
                                The <b> Queen </b> moves any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or

                                A <b> Knight </b> moves to the nearest square not on the same rank, file, or diagonal.
                                (This
                                can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or
                                moving
                                one square horizontally then two squares verticallyâ€”i.e. in an "L" pattern.) The knight
                                is
                                not blocked by other pieces: it jumps to the new location.

                                <b>Pawns </b> have the most complex rules of movement:

                                        A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has
                                        not
                                        yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward,
                                        provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.
                                    </li>

                                        Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. A pawn
                                        can
                                        capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the
                                        pawn
                                        (but cannot move to those squares if they are vacant).

                        <p class="line-spacing">
                            Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on
                            the
                            other side of the king, adjacent to it. It is not allowed to move both king and rook in the
                            same
                            time, because "Each move must be played with one hand only.". Castling is only permissible
                            if
                            all of the following conditions hold:

                                The king and rook involved in castling must not have previously moved;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                There must be no pieces between the king and the rook;

                            <li>
                                The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through or end up in a
                                square
                                that is under attack by an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack
                                and
                                to pass over an attacked square);

                                The castling must be kingside or queenside as shown in the diagram.
